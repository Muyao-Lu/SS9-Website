                <h2><span class="red">Breaking News</span> - Seven Years War Comes to an End!</h2>
                <p>After a long and arduous war spanning from <b>1756 to 1763</b>, humanity has finally decided to stop killing
                    itself after the signing of the <b>Treaty of Paris</b>. This long and bloody conflict which was beginning to
                    become boring for our human politics department to analyze has finally led to victory
                    on the side of the English and Prussians, leading to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The relinquishment of <b>French colonies in North America</b> to <b>Britain</b></li>
                    <li>The loss of <b>French</b> strongholds on the Indian Subcontinent, giving <b>Great Britan</b> control of <b>"All
                        of North America east of the Mississippi" (Wikipedia)</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>Bankruptcy of both <b>England and France</b>, which eventually caused <b>tax increases</b> in <b>British colonies</b> and 
                        widespread discontent leading to the <b>American Revolution</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>Transfer of lands between <b>Britan, France, and Spain</b></li>
                    <li>Rising tensions between <b>native inhabitants and colonizers</b> of <b>North America</b>, brought about by the differing
                        attitudes of the <b>British and French</b> towards <b>First Nations</b>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Canada</b> becoming a <b>British Colony</b></li>
                </ul>

                                <p>During this war, many lands were exchanged between the <b>French and British</b>, with battles being fought
                                    over vast expanses of <b>North America, Europe, and India</b>. With these tremendous changes in the geography,
                                    our map department has decided to create a map of North America, demonstrating the changes. Before the
                                    war, the continent was split between the <b>Spanish, French, and British</b>. However, as a concequence of the 
                                    <em>Treaty of Paris</em>, the <b>French</b> had to cede their land <b>(dark gray)</b> to the <b>British</b>, resulting in them losing most
                                    of their foothold in <b>North America</b>.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Elsewhere, in <b>Europe and India</b>, less dramatic changes occured. In <b>India</b>, the <b>French</b> were forced
                                    to destroy most of their forts, meanwhile, in <b>Europe</b>, the largest changes were not geographical, but
                                    political, with many of the participating countries <b>bankrupting themselves</b> through the long and
                                    arduous war.

                                battles also being fought in both <b>India and North America</b> (mainly the area around the 13 Colonies). One 
                                highly decisive <b>North American</b> battle that was fought between the <b>French and British</b> was the <em>seige of Quebec</em>
                                and the subsequent <em>Battle of the Plains of Abraham</em>. Occuring in <b>French Canada</b>, this battle saw generals
                                <b>Montcalm and Wolfe</b> face off against each other. Both men perished in battle, with the <b>British</b>
                                gaining the city of <b>Quebec</b>.

                    <hr>
                    <p>Though this war was incited for a number of reasons, and saw it's roots in the <em>War of Austrian Succession</em>, the 
                        catalyzing event that elevated this war to these heights was <b>conflicts between the British and French</b> over <b>colonies
                        in North America</b>. To delve deeper, as well as to answer any unanswered questions, we invited our resident Human Expert: <em>Dr. Fluffy</em>

                        <h4>The Human Corner, presented by Dr. Fluffy</h4>
                        <p><b>Q:</b> Why do you think that the <b>British and French</b>, as two superpowers representing the entire human
                            species, would go to a <b>war on this scale</b>? Are humans not as intelligent as we think they are?
                        </p>
                        <p><b>A:</b> Though humans are an intelligent species, they aren't perfectly rational. In a rational world,
                            the two nations would have solved their disputes via means of negotiation. However, when feelings
                            such as anger and fear are taken into account - especially <em>when money and resources are involved</em> (in the case 
                            of the <b>British and the French</b>, as their fighting was <em>centered around colonies and trade routes</em>), or <em>life itself</em> as with 
                            the case of the <b>First Nations</b>, the human species can and will put up quite a fight. The pitting of traditional
                            enemies exacerbated this even further, with the <b>Austrians and Prussians</b> as well as <b>French and English</b> both being enemies
                            for hundreds of years.<br>

                        <hr>
                        <p><b>Q:</b> In terms of weapons, are there any concerning developments in human tech that could threaten
                            hamsterkind?
                        </p>
                        <p><b>A:</b> Not particularly. Though this war demonstrated the <em>effictiveness of a strong navy and firearms</em> such as 
                            <b>flintlock pistols and muskets</b>, they have yet to figure out stronger guns, betting entire battles on the 
                            fact that their powder doesn't get wet. <b>Sabers and bayonets</b> were also used, but those have been around
                            since the Middle Ages, and don't seem to be going away anytime soon. In addition, the humans still have not
                            figured out the fact that standing and shooting at each other in organized linups is not the best way to fight, 
                            leaving hamster experts puzzled. <br>
                            - Cheers, Dr. Fluffy
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p><b>Q:</b> What will the war mean for humanity? How about hamsterkind?</p>
                        <p><b>A:</b> Tough question, however, it is forcasted that both the <b>British and French</b> economies will take a nosedive as they
                            spent quite a bit of money on fighting this war. <em>Increased oppression</em> of <b>First Nations</b> and other <b>French allies</b>
                            in <b>North America</b> will also likely occur, as the <b>French allies</b>x seem to be too concerned about their own failing economy
                            to be compassionate with anyone right now. Finally, I'm also hearing reports about the <b>French</b> <em>strengthening their 
                                military</em>, so that could mean another war (hopefully not). As for hamsters, I would recommend all individuals reading
                            this now to maintain a low profile. The last thing we need is an angry mob of post-war humans coming after us and the less
                            attention right now, the better. <br>
